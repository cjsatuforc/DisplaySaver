## Usage:
First see [How to install sample Add-Ins and Scripts](https://rawgit.com/AutodeskFusion360/AutodeskFusion360.github.io/master/Installation.html)

This addin allows you to save and retrieve the display of components in the graphics window.

It stores the saved display information in a folder called displaySaver in your user directory.  

## Limitations
  * Since the display information is stored locally it will only be availabel on the computer it was created.  Looking to add some kind of cloud support in the future.
  * If you have two models of the same name they are not distinguished. POtentially will add project directory to file names.
